# song-popularity-kaggle-competition

from https://www.kaggle.com/c/song-popularity-prediction

my first solo kaggle competition for predict song popularity.
i use IterativeImputer as fillna value in data
i use PCA 2 compomponent to feature engineer and speed the training
i use Random Forest as tree-based that not affected by outlier and imbalance data

i get AUC score 0.51073 in private dashboard rank 453 from 535 team. it's ok for my first solo :)
